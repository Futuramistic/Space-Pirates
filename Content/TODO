*** WHAT TO DO ***
** LEVEL DESIGN **
------------------

In terms of dealing with potential boundary breaks between the player, stations, and celestial objects

STARS & BLACK HOLES & LARGE OBJECTS:
* make as a pseudo-parallax
   * EX: the explorable area is 8000x8000x8000 and the background (skybox nonwithstanding) is 15000x15000x15000
   * all large objects will need to be blown up so they can be seen
   * saves the time from writing code to keep these objects forever at a certain distance away
* logically speaking, keeping large celestial objects out of the player's reach means that we don't have to deal with the physics (namely gravity) associated with pulling a player in, but keeps the spectacle


PLANETS
* surround only the planet with a blocking volume and some accompanying text telling the player to turn around
* surround the stations and by extension the planet with a trigger volume
   * can trigger either by passing by it or by button press (likely by button press)


SPACE DUST
* particle system
   * random sizes
   * if you want to keep realistic, try to randomize into a web pattern
   * only keep as small clumps
   * allow player to pass through without damage


ASTEROIDS
* a few moving throughout the level, mostly in a straight line
* if in a belt, keep large and close together
* can damage player
